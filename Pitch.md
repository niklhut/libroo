# Libroo: Your Library, Managed.

### **Vision**

Libroo is a private, physical-first library management system designed to turn "piles of books" into a curated, organized, and trackable collection. It bridges the gap between digital discovery and physical ownership, giving book lovers total clarity over what they own, where it is, and who is currently enjoying it.

### **The Problem: The "Invisible" Library**

Most modern book trackers focus on the *act* of reading, but fail at the *management* of physical assets. Physical book owners face three specific frustrations:

1. **The Acquisition Gap:** Users often have "Want to Read" lists that mix books they already own with books they haven't bought yet, leading to accidental duplicates or forgotten treasures on their own shelves.

2. **The Lending "Black Hole":** Generous readers love to lend books to friends, but without a system, those books often disappear forever because both parties forget who has what.

3. **Spatial Chaos:** In larger collections, finding a specific book across multiple rooms, boxes, or shelves becomes a manual chore.

### **The Solution: Libroo**

Libroo is a dedicated "Personal Librarian" in your pocket. It is built specifically for the needs of physical book collectors, focusing on inventory management, lending logistics, and shelf organization.

#### **Core Pillars**

* **Physical Inventory First:** Unlike social trackers, Libroo’s primary goal is to mirror your physical reality. It distinguishes between "Owned," "Wishlisted," and "Lending" states.

* **The Lending Ledger:** A built-in system to track loans. Know exactly which friend has your copy of a book, when they took it, and how long they’ve had it.

* **Shelf Mapping:** Assign books to specific physical locations (e.g., "Living Room—Shelf B" or "Storage Box 4"), making your entire home searchable.

* **Frictionless Entry:** Use high-speed barcode scanning to catalog books in minutes, pulling high-quality metadata and covers automatically.

### **Target Audience**

* **The "Home Librarian":** Collectors with 100+ books who want an organized, searchable database of their assets.

* **The Social Lender:** Readers who frequently share books and want a polite way to keep track of their "floating" inventory.

* **The Privacy Advocate:** Users who want to own their data and assets locally, away from major tech conglomerates.

### **Philosophy & Values**

* **Longevity:** Books last decades; their data should too. Libroo is designed for permanent records.

* **Privacy-First:** Your collection is your business. Your library data belongs to you.

* **Aesthetic Utility:** A clean interface that celebrates cover art while remaining a powerful utility tool.
